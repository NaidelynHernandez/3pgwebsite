<h4> The Effects on our democracy </h4>
<p class="support" > Voter Purges,Felony Disenfranchisement,Gerrymandering, voter ID Laws, Voter registration restrictions
  <br> are all forms of voter suppression that greatly effects one group of people mainly minorities.
  <br>  Through these they are unable to cast their vote due to their unfair circumstance.
  <br>  This in turn does not fullfill the principlals of democracy as there are barriers that stop people from voting and having their voice heard. </p>


<h4> Voter Suppression by the Numbers </h4>
<p class="support">In 2011, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach championed a law requiring Kansans to show “proof of citizenship” documents in order to register to vote.
  <br>
  Most people don’t carry the required documents on hand — like a passport, or a birth certificate — and as a result, the law blocked over 30,000 Kansans from voting. </p>
 <p class="support"> In 2016, Arkansas purged thousands of voters for so-called felony convictions, even though some of the voters had never been convicted of a felony at all</p>
  <p class= "support">in 2013, Virginia purged 39,000 voters based on data that was later found to have an error rate of up to 17 percent.
